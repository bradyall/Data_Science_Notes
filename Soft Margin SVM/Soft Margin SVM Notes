How to tell if overfitting in SVM:

if the # of SV / # samples > ~10 percent, it should be a signal that you are overfitting

Hard Margin is an SVM where none of the samples violate the margin
Soft Margin, which is the default in most packages, allows for violations

We are going to measure the slack with epsilon (e)

The total slack will be the sum of ei

In or SVM derivation, we said that we want to minimize ||w||, which for ease of quadratic programming, we transformed to
min 1/2||w||**2.
For Soft margin SVM, we say that we want to min 1/2||w||**2 + c*sum(ei)

What is c? c is where we decide how important slack is. We get to set it ourselves.
The more we raise c, the lower e needs to be when minimizing, i.e. how important e needs to be. This keeps us from over-
fitting our data. In SVM, often datasets are frequently not lineraly seperable.

See http://cvxopt.org/userguide/coneprog.html#quadratic-programming for cvxopt documentation. This is particularly
helpful for understanding the variables




How to use SVM with multiple classes?

One versus Rest (OVR): generally the default
you separate one class against the rest and repeat for all classes
this can be a little challenging because you will almost certainly have more data on one side of the margin every time
you split the data.

One versus One (OVO):
you separate one class from another, ignoring all non-relevant classes and repeat for all permuations.
For a new point, it decides that the point is on one side of 1 vers 2, so it could be a 2 or 3, but then it is on the 3 side
of the 2 v 3 hyperplane, so it must be a 3
