Mean shift

Mean shift works by setting all points in dataset as a cluster and defining a radius around that point.
If another point falls within that radius, the algorithm then finds the mean of the points and sets another radius.
This process repeats until the clusters converge.

Mean shift can also set outer radii with small weights, which can provide a hierarchical formation to the data
