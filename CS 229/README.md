# CS229: Machine Learning Solutions

This repository compiles the problem sets and my solutions to [Stanford's Machine Learning graduate class (CS229)](http://cs229.stanford.edu/), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The problems sets are the ones given for the class of Fall 2017.

For each problem set, solutions are provided as an iPython Notebook.

## Problem Set 1: Supervised Learning

The first problem set deals with simple supervised learning models:
